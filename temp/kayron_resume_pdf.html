      <h2>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <div class="philosophy-statement">
        I believe the most powerful design doesn't declare itself—it invites you in.
        My work exists between creation and consumption, where meaning isn't made but met.
        Reflection isn't the outcome; it's the medium. Ritual becomes interface. Silence becomes authorship.
        I lead like I create: collaboratively, with clarity, and without control. That has cost me time, certainty, and pride.
        I've clung too tightly to elegance. I've chased clarity until the work lost its edge.
        I've stayed quiet when I should have pushed, and pushed when I should have listened.
        I'll delete my best work to protect coherence. But I won't let a clever idea replace an honest one.
        That's the line I don't cross.
