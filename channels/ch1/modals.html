      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I believe the most powerful creations exist at the intersection of logic and emotion, strategy and artistry. My work as a financial analyst, business consultant, and creative entrepreneur is driven by the idea that numbers tell a story—and stories shape the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether refining financial models for leading entertainment brands like HBO, Netflix, and Amazon, launching fragrance concepts through Coloring with Gray, or advising brands on how to build cultural relevance, my approach is always rooted in innovation, depth, and intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Founder &amp; Creative Director of Coloring with Gray, I design experiences that challenge perspectives—starting with "Reflections of You", a luxury fragrance crafted to evolve with the wearer. My work isn’t about following trends—it’s about setting new standards and redefining how we experience the world through creativity, commerce, and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m here to build something different. Let’s make it happen.
